# Machine Learning Algorithms

# Aim
To practice machine learning algorithms.

## Algorithms
The following algorithms have been implemented by me.
 1. Simple Linear Regression.
 2. Multi-variate Linear Regression.
 3. L1 Regularisation Regression.
 4.  L2 Regularisation Regression.
 5. Gradient Descent for linear and logistic regression.
 6. Logistic Regression
 7. Naive Bayes Algorithm
 8. K-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm.
 9. Decision Trees
 10. Perceptrons

## Installation

 1. Git clone this repository or download as zip or download selected files.
 2. Note : you should have jupyter notebook installed for this or you can also use google colab.
	 <span>Google Colab - <a>https://colab.research.google.com/</a></span>
	 <span>Jupyter Notebook Download - <a>https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#:~:text=Anaconda%20Navigator%20is%20a%20desktop,without%20using%20command%2Dline%20commands.</a></span>
 3. Python ^3.6 is expected to be installed and the corresponding valid versions for numpy, scikit-learn and matplotlib libraries needs to be installed.
 
# Data
The data is easily available on kaggle and UCI repository. For reference:
#### Linear Regression
1. Moore's Law Dataset -- Already present in the repository (Moore's.txt)
2. Predicting Systole BP -- Present in the repository (mlr02.xls)

#### Logistic Regression
1. Ecommerce Dataset -- ecommerce_data.xlsx present in the folder where Logistic regression folder.


#### KNN, Naive Bayes, Decision Trees and Perceptron
